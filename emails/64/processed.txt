I have been offered a job at IRS on south IH35. They offered me the second shift. I use the city bus for all my transportation.
 I do not drive. I can get to work fine but I
 don't get off till 1230. The last bus leaves at 1145 headed back north where I
 live.Please answer soon as possible as I must accept or reject job.
