Sounds good. I don't plan on venturing out again until tuesday so it should be resolved by then. Is there a way for me to donate the 1 way pass and day pass i bought this morning to someone else? I buy 31 day passes and won't need them.You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her thinkOn Sat, Feb 13, 2021, 16:47 Customer Service Customer.Service@capmetro.org wrote:
Thank you. Please try these steps until you can see your passes.
Have the customers swipe down in the Tickets screens to refresh the view to see if their
tickets reappear.If step 1 doesnâ€™t work, then customers can try to close and reopen the app to see if their
tickets reappear.
If steps 1 or 2 do not work, customers should log out of the app and back in. Their tickets should reappear after this step for sure
