Thank you. Please try these steps until you can see your passes.
Have the customers swipe down in the Tickets screens to refresh the view to see if their
tickets reappear.If step 1 doesnâ€™t work, then customers can try to close and reopen the app to see if their
tickets reappear.
If steps 1 or 2 do not work, customers should log out of the app and back in. Their tickets should reappear after this step for sure
