Subject: Free Fares during Cold Snap
EXTERNAL E-MAIL
I beg of you. Please suspend fares during this catastrophic cold snap. Homeless people who don’t have enough money for fares and are unable to walk far enough—maybe they are already freezing—can’t get to what few shelters there are at
this time. The poor are suffering because of this cold spell and some will die. Please, Capital Metro—help Austin get through this compassionately.
Sincerely,
Fancy Fairchild
