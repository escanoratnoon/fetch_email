Thanks for the quick response!It seems I can use the two day passes now. However, my original 31 day pass is greyed-out, with a "data error: contact customer service" message over it.-MilesOn Sat, Feb 13, 2021, 4:29 PM Customer Service Customer.Service@capmetro.org wrote:
Mr. Worthington,
The issue should be resolved. Please check to see if you can see and access your passes.
Thank you,
Sondra Williams
