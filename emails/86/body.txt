Okay first of all I bought a 31 day bus pass Order CM3422313-705 on
1/12/21. I didn't active it until 1/16/21. Today your app was
malfunctioning and running really slow and sometimes not loading my prepaid
ticket when I was trying to ride the bus. My 31 day pass was good until
2/17/21. So I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling the app and when
I opened it again my 31 day pass was gone. I know I signed into the same
account the 31 day pass was on and it wasn't there. I had a lot of things
going on today and it didn't help that it was like 32 degrees outside, I
tried calling your customer service line and the operator was somewhat
helpful but he didn't resolve the issue. So then I tried buying just one
$1.25 single ride bus pass and your app didn't let me buy one on my account
with the username jordanburson00@gmail.com. I tried twice and it didn't
work. So I switched to another username gulfstream812@gmail.com and put in
my card information to verify that it is really me and finally was able to
purchase the ticket. So all I received was one $1.25 single ride ticket in
the account with the username gulfstream812@gmail.com. I finally got home
and looked at the statements from both cards I used which with only one I
was able to buy one 1.25 bus pass. You charged me twice in my card ending
with 3164 and once with my card ending in 1926 and I only received one
$1.25 bus pass. You can look it up on my account. I wasn't able to answer
the phone call when your operator tried calling me back, like I said it was
32 degrees outside and I was just trying to get inside someplace. Please
write me back and check on the orders and details I presented to you here
and let me know what you are going to do to resolve this issue. I have
experienced minor problems in the past using your app but never anything
like this. My phone number is 512-202-7457 or you can email me back at this
email address. Please respond as soon as you can. Thank you.
