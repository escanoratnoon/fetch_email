 an active ticket of mine meant to remain active until the 14th, and now I find it is deleted.
 Even after closing and redownloading the metro app,
 it does not allow me to refresh or rebuy a new ticket. I've downloaded money twice.I need this app to work by 7am tomorrow morning so that I may go to work in the freezing temperatures. Please let me know as soon as possible how this can be fixed.Lucia Pistoneluciaphone997@gmail.comApp Name: Capital MetroApp Version : 4.31.2 1057OS Version : 10
