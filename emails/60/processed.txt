John,
There really isn’t enough information to go on with the information provided so far.
Is there an error message that the customer receives when trying to download/install the CapMetro App? Please send over a screenshot showing the issue downloading/installing the app.According to what I seen in the backoffice for account
dresfacekick@gmail.com,
the customer has an Android phone. What version of the Android OS does the customer have on their phone?

I recently tried to reinstall the capmetro app to my galaxy phone and was not able to. I chatted with
 Google support
 and ran through all trouble shooting with no new results.
I was directed to contact you for a resolution to my predicament. As I am reliant on the bus services to receive my medication from the pharmacy I hope to have this resolved asap. Thank you.
