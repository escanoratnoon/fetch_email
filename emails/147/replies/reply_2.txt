Subject: My e-ticket has disappeared!
Good day.
I just bought a $41 31-day ticket Wednesday and used it Wednesday and Thursday. It said it was good through 3/13. Today I go to board the bus and the app says I have no active tickets. What gives! If I can't use the e-ticket then I want my money refunded.
Please find out what's going on with your system, because I rely on the bus to get to and from work. I don't mind paying cash, but I need to know that I'll need some.
Thank you very much.
