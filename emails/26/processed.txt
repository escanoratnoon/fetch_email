I also wanted to report a black female that I also have a video of showing out at the bus stop and on the bus.She was on the bus making threats, cussing at passengers for no reason, name calling, screaming for God, and telling people to get out of the bus. She also pulled her pants down at the bus stop and urinated on the ground in front of everyone before the bus pulled up. I also have the driver ID, bus number and time for that so that video tapes can be pulled. Why is this nonsense behavior allowed on the bus?

I would contact them at 512-474-1200 in order to file a formal complaint if you would like. In the future if you ever feel there is a threat to life or bodily harm to yourself or other customers please call 911 for assistance. I have forwarded both this report and the other report to customer service for them to follow up with the situation. Thank you and have a good night.
