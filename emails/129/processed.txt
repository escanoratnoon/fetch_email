I have refunded the passes for you. I have credited a day pass for the day you were unable to use it.

How many passes did you want? I will work on reimbursing the remainder that you do not need.

Thank you. Will my money be reimbursed for all the bus passes I was charged and have not used or activated?

Ms. Garcia,
The issue should be resolved. Please check to see if you can see and access your passes.
Thank you,

I tried to purchase a new monthly pass and it said my transaction was cancelled to try again. So I did. 3 times. Then I decided to wait. Tried riding the bus and my active monthly pass was erased. Tried purchasing a daily pass and
it also said transaction was
cancelled to try again. Ended up buying a daily pass cash to ride bus. I looked on my bank account and all the passes were charged. But when I log in to the Cap Metro App it shows no available passes. How can I resolve this issue??
And May I please get a refund for my money?? Thank you!
