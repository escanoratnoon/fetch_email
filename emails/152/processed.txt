I do not see where we have credited this customer so yes ok to give a pass.
 I’m not sure why the customer used it and stated the battery died due to rides are free so if the customer would have attempted to use the pass the driver should
have let the customer know it was free.

Good evening,
Would we be able to offer any assistance for this customer?
The customer stated he was not able to use his Single ride pass after purchase because his battery died.
Thank you,
John Torres

I tried to use a ticket today, however my phone died and I wasn’t able to actually use the ticket. Could I possibly get a new ticket?
Thank you and happy Valentine’s Day!
