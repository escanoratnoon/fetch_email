I was at Stop Id 5931 which is bus 311 boarding about 5:45am. As i proceded to board the bus the driver who was an african female rudely told me that next time i needed to be fast on boarding the bus. How could i have done that if there was a City of Austin vehicle in the pathway of bus. So driver of bus had to stop few feet away. She even proceded to honk the horn at me. And thats when she told me that i needed to be faster next time. I felt this was uncalled for. And she was driving way too fast as if she was late.  you need to take care of this matter soon as possible is this was uncalled for
