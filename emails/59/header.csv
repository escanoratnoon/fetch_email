I have to say I am always having issues with busses connecting to the next bus. Seems the bus is always a few minutes too late to catch another one. Having me sit for 30+ minutes every single time. Right now being 28 degrees outside and the bus that happened to be running late didn't even stop at the actual stop bit just drove through the transit center and out the exit again. No stop. The busses I'm taking are the 311 from Stassney to Westgate transit center stop #2491 and then taking the 30 at stop F if I actually make it in time. I don't know if this is how they always run but I've had constant issues for the last couple years.
