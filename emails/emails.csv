Composing these e-mails to Capital Metro consumes even more of my limited time.Yesterday (Wednesday, February 10, 2021--BEFORE the weather turned bad in the Austin area), I was onboard a NORTHBOUND Route 300 bus.  The vehicle number of the bus was 2628 and, according to the overhead display, the Operator's ID was 311090.At approximately 3:45 pm, the driver parked the bus near the McDonald's restaurant located at 303 East Oltorf Street and, empty-handed, she entered the restaurant.  She emerged at 3:53 pm with a bag having a McDonald's logo on it and with a beverage cup likewise bearing the McDonald's logo.  I have no way of knowing if her entry into the restaurant was also for the purpose of using a restroom to which, of course, a bus driver is entitled.  She resumed driving the bus after keeping us waiting for several minutes.I did happen to notice that she consumed food while paused for a red light before crossing over Parker Lane.  She did the same at a red light before crossing over the next intersection at Burleson Road.  I also happened to notice her drinking the beverage while the bus was actually in motion while northbound on Springdale Road after crossing over East Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and I noticed again that--while the bus in fact was in motion--she again drank from the beverage while northbound on Cameron Road while approaching East 52nd Street.It may be that Capital Metro is OK with all of this but I will tell you that from the viewpoint of a passenger, these ""optics"" are not good.  If this conduct is NOT in compliance with Capital Metro policy, then please consider this as my formal complaint against this driver and a review of the video from the bus would be encouraged.Just when I thought that things could not go down-hill any further, Capital Metro proved me wrong.A bit later that same day, I boarded a NORTHBOUND Route 383 bus (Vehicle number 2565 and, according to the overhead display, Operator ID 305830) which departed the North Lamar Transit Center at 5:30 pm.When the bus arrived on northbound Burnet Road, just south of Longhorn Boulevard at approximately 5:40 pm (at the bus stop labeled ""Rutland""station), the driver suddenly parked and then exited from the bus.She struck up a conversation with a man who was standing near the bus stop and then got on her cell phone to make a call.  At first, this angered me.  However, she later told those of us onboard that this was the location at which there was to be a switch of drivers as she, herself, would be re-assigned to a different route at that point.We sat there on vehicle 2565 and waited and waited and waited.  She then told us that we would have to resume our travel on the next-scheduled Route 383 bus.  At 6:09 pm--having waited for a half hour--the next-scheduled Route 383 bus (vehicle 2512) did arrive and all of us exited vehicle 2565 in order to board vehicle 2512.  This was a significant delay for me in getting to my destination and it does not reflect well upon Capital Metro to have this level of disorder in its administrative functions.The average Austinite has a choice in the matter because--unlike me--the average Austinite has access to a vehicle.  Pandemic--or no pandemic--these examples from yesterday show why the average Austinite will not bother to use public transportation (and relieve traffic congestion on Austin's notoriously-busy roadways) as there are so many examples of difficulty and poor-quality service in what should be the simple task of getting people from Point A to Point B in timely fashion.A reply would be much-appreciated.Thank you,GREGORY WATSONThursday, February 11, 2021"

Details:
Reference: TRWEB
There was a black male passenger on the bus today talking to himself, cursing, fighting and harressing the other passengers including myself. This man got off the bus and made gestures towards his genitals and began beating on the outside windows for our attention. The driver did nothing to stop the behavior and told me to call the police when I asked him why he allowed this to go on on his bus. I’m attaching a video too if I can and I have the route number, bus driver ID and time.

Composing these e-mails to Capital Metro consumes even more of my limited time.Yesterday (Wednesday, February 10, 2021--BEFORE the weather turned bad in the Austin area), I was onboard a NORTHBOUND Route 300 bus. The vehicle number of the bus was 2628 and, according to the overhead display, the Operator's ID was 311090.At approximately 3:45 pm, the driver parked the bus near the McDonald's restaurant located at 303 East Oltorf Street and, empty-handed, she entered the restaurant. She emerged at 3:53 pm with a bag having a McDonald's logo on it and with a beverage cup likewisebearing the McDonald's logo. I have no way of knowing if her entry into the restaurant was also for the purpose of using a restroom to which, of course, a bus driver is entitled. She resumed driving the bus after keeping us waiting for several minutes.I did happen to notice that she consumed food while paused for a red light before crossing over Parker Lane. She did the same at a red light before crossing over the next intersection at Burleson Road. I also happened to notice her drinking the beverage whilethe bus was actually in motion while northbound on Springdale Road after crossing over East Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and I noticed again that--while the bus in fact was in motion--she again drank from the beverage while northbound on Cameron Roadwhile approaching East 52nd Street.It may be that Capital Metro is OK with all of this but I will tell you that from the viewpoint of a passenger, these ""optics"" are not good. If this conduct is NOT in compliance with Capital Metro policy, then please consider this as my formal complaint againstthis driver and a review of the video from the bus would be encouraged.Just when I thought that things could not go down-hill any further, Capital Metro proved me wrong.A bit later that same day, I boarded a NORTHBOUND Route 383 bus (Vehicle number 2565 and, according to the overhead display, Operator ID 305830) which departed the North Lamar Transit Center at 5:30 pm.When the bus arrived on northbound Burnet Road, just south of Longhorn Boulevard at approximately 5:40 pm (at the bus stop labeled ""Rutland""station), the driver suddenly parked and then exited from the bus.She struck up a conversation with a man who was standing near the bus stop and then got on her cell phone to make a call. At first, this angered me. However, she later told those of us onboard that this was the location at which there was to be a switch ofdrivers as she, herself, would be re-assigned to a different route at that point.We sat there on vehicle 2565 and waited and waited and waited. She then told us that we would have to resume our travel on the next-scheduled Route 383 bus. At 6:09 pm--having waited for a half hour--the next-scheduled Route 383 bus (vehicle 2512) did arriveand all of us exited vehicle 2565 in order to board vehicle 2512. This was a significant delay for me in getting to my destination and it does not reflect well upon Capital Metro to have this level of disorder in its administrative functions.The average Austinite has a choice in the matter because--unlike me--the average Austinite has access to a vehicle. Pandemic--or no pandemic--these examples from yesterday show why the average Austinite will not bother to use public transportation (and relievetraffic congestion on Austin's notoriously-busy roadways) as there are so many examples of difficulty and poor-quality service in what should be the simple task of getting people from Point A to Point B in timely fashion.A reply would be much-appreciated.Thank you,GREGORY WATSONThursday, February 11, 2021"

I also wanted to report a black female that I also have a video of showing out at the bus stop and on the bus.She was on the bus making threats, cussing at passengers for no reason, name calling, screaming for God, and telling people to get out of the bus. She also pulled her pants down at the bus stop and urinated on the ground in front of everyone before the bus pulled up. I also have the driver ID, bus number and time for that so that video tapes can be pulled. Why is this nonsense behavior allowed on the bus?

Subject: Another Bad Day on Capital Metro (Wed., Feb. 10, 2021)
EXTERNAL E-MAIL
Hello, again, Tangee Mobley:
My time is valuable to me and I am a busy person.  Composing these e-mails to Capital Metro consumes even more of my limited time.
Yesterday (Wednesday, February 10, 2021--BEFORE the weather turned bad in the Austin area), I was onboard a NORTHBOUND Route 300 bus.  The vehicle number of the bus was 2628 and, according to the overhead display, the Operator's ID was 311090.
At approximately 3:45 pm, the driver parked the bus near the McDonald's restaurant located at 303 East Oltorf Street and, empty-handed, she entered the restaurant.  She emerged at 3:53 pm with a bag having a McDonald's logo on it and with a beverage cup likewise bearing the McDonald's logo.  I have no way of knowing if her entry into the restaurant was also for the purpose of using a restroom to which, of course, a bus driver is entitled.  She resumed driving the bus after keeping us waiting for several minutes.
I did happen to notice that she consumed food while paused for a red light before crossing over Parker Lane.  She did the same at a red light before crossing over the next intersection at Burleson Road.  I also happened to notice her drinking the beverage while the bus was actually in motion while northbound on Springdale Road after crossing over East Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and I noticed again that--while the bus in fact was in motion--she again drank from the beverage while northbound on Cameron Road while approaching East 52nd Street.
It may be that Capital Metro is OK with all of this but I will tell you that from the viewpoint of a passenger, these ""optics"" are not good.  If this conduct is NOT in compliance with Capital Metro policy, then please consider this as my formal complaint against this driver and a review of the video from the bus would be encouraged.
Just when I thought that things could not go down-hill any further, Capital Metro proved me wrong.
A bit later that same day, I boarded a NORTHBOUND Route 383 bus (Vehicle number 2565 and, according to the overhead display, Operator ID 305830) which departed the North Lamar Transit Center at 5:30 pm.
When the bus arrived on northbound Burnet Road, just south of Longhorn Boulevard at approximately 5:40 pm (at the bus stop labeled ""Rutland""
station), the driver suddenly parked and then exited from the bus.
She struck up a conversation with a man who was standing near the bus stop and then got on her cell phone to make a call.  At first, this angered me.  However, she later told those of us onboard that this was the location at which there was to be a switch of drivers as she, herself, would be re-assigned to a different route at that point.
We sat there on vehicle 2565 and waited and waited and waited.  She then told us that we would have to resume our travel on the next-scheduled Route 383 bus.  At 6:09 pm--having waited for a half hour--the next-scheduled Route 383 bus (vehicle 2512) did arrive and all of us exited vehicle 2565 in order to board vehicle 2512.  This was a significant delay for me in getting to my destination and it does not reflect well upon Capital Metro to have this level of disorder in its administrative functions.
The average Austinite has a choice in the matter because--unlike me--the average Austinite has access to a vehicle.  Pandemic--or no pandemic--these examples from yesterday show why the average Austinite will not bother to use public transportation (and relieve traffic congestion on Austin's notoriously-busy roadways) as there are so many examples of difficulty and poor-quality service in what should be the simple task of getting people from Point A to Point B in timely fashion.
A reply would be much-appreciated.
Thank you,
GREGORY WATSON

There really isn’t enough information to go on with the information provided so far.
Is there an error message that the customer receives when trying to download/install the CapMetro App? Please send over a screenshot showing the issue downloading/installing the app.According to what I seen in the backoffice for account

the customer has an Android phone. What version of the Android OS does the customer have on their phone?

When they aren't consistent. I'm tired of complaining about it. I more tired of having to wait 2 hrs to get home work when I live less than 10 minutes away. It's like you guys don't care about the ones who aren't fortunate enough to have a car.  I just don't see how the 243 will go west bound then get to tech ridge and go back east instead of continuing west like it's supposed to. Then when the 243 is pulling up the 392 is leaving. It's MAJOR inconvenience. I've complained over the phone so many times and yet nothing has been adjusted. After talk to others I know I'm not the only one to complain. The level of inconsideration is down right disrespectful and disgusting.Carl Nuckolsacrmu6nxpi@privaterelay.appleid.comApp Version: 4.023 2OS Version: 14.2Sent from my iPhone

I have to say I am always having issues with busses connecting to the next bus. Seems the bus is always a few minutes too late to catch another one. Having me sit for 30+ minutes every single time. Right now being 28 degrees outside and the bus that happened to be running late didn't even stop at the actual stop bit just drove through the transit center and out the exit again. No stop. The busses I'm taking are the 311 from Stassney to Westgate transit center stop #2491 and then taking the 30 at stop F if I actually make it in time. I don't know if this is how they always run but I've had constant issues for the last couple years.

Okay first of all I bought a 31 day bus pass Order CM3422313-705 on 1/12/21. I didn't active it until 1/16/21. Today your app was malfunctioning and running really slow and sometimes not loading my prepaid ticket when I was trying to ride the bus. My 31 day pass was good until 2/17/21. So I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling the app and when I opened it again my 31 day pass was gone. I know I signed into the same account the 31 day pass was on and it wasn't there. I had a lot of things going on today and it didn't help that it was like 32 degrees outside, I tried calling your customer service line and the operator was somewhat helpful but he didn't resolve the issue. So then I tried buying just one $1.25 single ride bus pass and your app didn't let me buy one on my account with the username jordanburson00@gmail.com. I tried twice and it
didn't work. So I switched to another username gulfstream812@gmail.com and put in my card information to verify that it is really me and finally was able to purchase the ticket. So all I received was one $1.25 single ride ticket in the account with the username gulfstream812@gmail.com. I finally got home and looked at the statements from both cards I used which with only one I was able to buy one 1.25 bus pass. You charged me twice in my card ending with 3164 and once with my card ending in 1926 and I only received one $1.25 bus pass. You can look it up on my account. I wasn't able to answer the phone call when your operator tried calling me back, like I said it was 32 degrees outside and I was just trying to get inside someplace. Please write me back and check on the orders and details I presented to you here and let me know what you are going to do to resolve this issue. I have experienced minor problems in the past using your app but never anything like this. My phone number is 512-202-7457 or you can email me back at this email address. Please respond as soon as you can. Thank you.

The problem is without proper training. Driver 307620 is overly aggressive and almost abusive to some of the passengers. She needs to understand that some of her passengers have mental health issues. They don'tmean any harm to her. What she is doing is actually trying to start trouble with her passengers by being extremely aggressive and down right mean. Please give her the proper training before she causes some real harm.

In this case the paratransit service denied service

The paratransit system must still run as long as the main bus route runs to give people with disabilities equal access to CWS that can not use the regular buses. The main bus routes will also shut down due to weather.Additionally, They should extend their 1/4 mile limits from the nearest bus routes or bus stops to ensure people with a disability can get access to transportation,
