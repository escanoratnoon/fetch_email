App Version : 4.31.2 1057
OS Version : 7.1.1 Hello I ride the bus home every day and your driver 307620 for the 801 route at 6:45 am this morning. I have to report her to you. I would usually overlook a situation like this one but this driver is having a hard time with her passengers.
With a little training I think she would do fine. The problem is without proper training. Driver 307620 is overly aggressive and almost abusive to some of the passengers. She needs to understand that some of her passengers have mental health issues. They don't
mean any harm to her. What she is doing is actually trying to start trouble with her passengers by being extremely aggressive and down right mean. Please give her the proper training before she causes some real harm.
