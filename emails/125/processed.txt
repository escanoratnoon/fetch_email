That is wonderful! I have also credited a Local Day pass to your account for you to use at your convenience for the day you were unable to access your pass.

Okay first of all I bought a 31 day bus pass Order CM3422313-705 on 1/12/21. I didn't active it until 1/16/21. Today your app was malfunctioning and running really slow and sometimes
not loading my prepaid ticket when I was trying to ride the bus. My 31 day pass was good until 2/17/21. So I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling the app and when I opened it again my 31 day pass was gone. I know I signed into the same account the 31
day pass was on and it wasn't there. I had a lot of things going on today and it didn't help that it was like 32 degrees outside, I tried calling your customer service line and the operator was somewhat helpful but he didn't resolve the issue. So then I tried
buying just one $1.25 single ride bus pass and your app didn't let me buy one on my account with the username
jordanburson00@gmail.com. I tried twice and it
didn't work. So I switched to another username
gulfstream812@gmail.com and put in my card information to verify that it is really me and finally was able to purchase the ticket. So all I received was one $1.25 single ride ticket in the account
with the username gulfstream812@gmail.com. I finally got home and looked at the statements from both cards I used which with only one I was able to buy one 1.25 bus pass. You charged me twice in
my card ending with 3164 and once with my card ending in 1926 and I only received one $1.25 bus pass. You can look it up on my account. I wasn't able to answer the phone call when your operator tried calling me back, like I said it was 32 degrees outside and
I was just trying to get inside someplace. Please write me back and check on the orders and details I presented to you here and let me know what you are going to do to resolve this issue. I have experienced minor problems in the past using your app but never
anything like this. My phone number is 512-202-7457 or you can email me back at this email address. Please respond as soon as you can. Thank you.
