Reference: TRWEB
There was a black male passenger on the bus today talking to himself, cursing, fighting and harressing the other passengers including myself. This man got off the bus and made gestures towards his genitals and began beating on the outside windows for our attention. The driver did nothing to stop the behavior and told me to call the police when I asked him why he allowed this to go on on his bus. Iâ€™m attaching a video too if I can and I have the route number, bus driver ID and time.
