But I desperately need help. My 31 day pass for this month has disappeared from my available tickets list, although its expiration is 2/26. Also, when I was trying to board this morning I attempted to purchase two(2) single passes where I have the separate charge notifications from my bank, but was given an error message and no access to tickets. I've uninstalled the app from my phone several times, cleared my cache, and power cycled my phone with no positive effect. If there is anything that can be done to retrieve my passes, I will greatly appreciate your assistance. Thank you for your time and effort.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Be well,</div><div dir="auto"><br><br>Jacob Juarez<br>snake007_jj@hotmail.com<br>App Name: Capital Metro<br>App Version : 4.31.2 1057<br>OS Version : 10 p</div></div>
