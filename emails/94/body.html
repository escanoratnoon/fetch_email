I'm still owed atleast a week and a half on the pass I purchased, plus the day pass that I had again.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">There was someone else on the #20 bus who was having the same&nbsp;issue.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Thanks</div><div dir="auto"><br><br>Edgardo Pina<br><a href="mailto:mark245pineapple@gmail.com">mark245pineapple@gmail.com</a><br>App Name: Capital Metro<br>App Version : 4.31.2 1057<br>OS Version : 10&nbsp;</div></div>
