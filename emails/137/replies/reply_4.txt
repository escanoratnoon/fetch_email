Hi,
I've been having issues accessing my 31-day pass, on my phone, since yesterday. The pass is in my app under "available", but when I click on it my screen goes black and the app
crashes.
And on a semi-related note, I've also tried buying two of the $2.50 day passes through the app via Google Pay, but got two "order failed" messages. However, my card was still charged
it seems, so I may need a refund on those.
Thanks for any help!
