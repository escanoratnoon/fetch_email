Glad to hear you can access the others. Please follow the steps below for the data error:
Log out of the device
Wait a minute and log back in
Tap the three horizontal line menu in the left-hand corner of the screen
Tap More
Tap Ticket Storage; the ticket should show saved to the cloud
Tap the icon to the right of the ticket to save it to the device
NOTE: You may need to force close and reopen the app if the ticket wonâ€™t display
After the above steps, the pass should be ready for use.
I have also credited a Local Day pass for the time you were unable to access your pass.
