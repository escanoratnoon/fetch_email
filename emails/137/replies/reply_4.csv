The pass is in my app under ""available"", but when I click on it my screen goes black and the appcrashes.And on a semi-related note, I've also tried buying two of the $2.50 day passes through the app via Google Pay, but got two ""order failed"" messages. However, my card was still chargedit seems, so I may need a refund on those.Thanks for any help!Miles Worthingtonmeworthington1@gmail.comApp Name: Capital MetroApp Version : 4.31.2 1057OS Version : 11"
