Glad to hear you can access the others. Please follow the steps below for the data error:
Log out of the device
Wait a minute and log back in
Tap the three horizontal line menu in the left-hand corner of the screen
Tap More
Tap Ticket Storage; the ticket should show saved to the cloud
Tap the icon to the right of the ticket to save it to the device
NOTE: You may need to force close and reopen the app if the ticket wonâ€™t display
After the above steps, the pass should be ready for use.
I have also credited a Local Day pass for the time you were unable to access your pass.

Thanks for the quick response!
It seems I can use the two day passes now. However, my original 31 day pass is greyed-out, with a "data error: contact customer service" message over it.

Hi,
I've been having issues accessing my 31-day pass, on my phone, since yesterday. The pass is in my app under "available", but when I click on it my screen goes black and the app
crashes.
And on a semi-related note, I've also tried buying two of the $2.50 day passes through the app via Google Pay, but got two "order failed" messages. However, my card was still charged
it seems, so I may need a refund on those.
Thanks for any help!
