Subject: Bus 7 at Stop #5377

My partner has been WAITING for bus for 2 hours since some routes have been cancelled and I am VERY WORRIED - especially at his age!   Iâ€™ve prayed for the last hour that he would be home safe.  Please do something that he can be brought to my home safely.  Thank you.
