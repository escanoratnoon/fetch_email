EXTERNAL E-MAIL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, again, Tangee Mobley:<br>
<br>
My time is valuable to me and I am a busy person.&nbsp; Composing these e-mails to Capital Metro consumes even more of my limited time.<br>
<br>
Yesterday (Wednesday, February 10, 2021--BEFORE the weather turned bad in the Austin area), I was onboard a NORTHBOUND Route 300 bus.&nbsp; The vehicle number of the bus was 2628 and, according to the overhead display, the Operator's ID was 311090.<br>
<br>
At approximately 3:45 pm, the driver parked the bus near the McDonald's restaurant located at 303 East Oltorf Street and, empty-handed, she entered the restaurant.&nbsp; She emerged at 3:53 pm with a bag having a McDonald's logo on it and with a beverage cup likewise
 bearing the McDonald's logo.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing if her entry into the restaurant was also for the purpose of using a restroom to which, of course, a bus driver is entitled.&nbsp; She resumed driving the bus after keeping us waiting for several minutes.<br>
<br>
I did happen to notice that she consumed food while paused for a red light before crossing over Parker Lane.&nbsp; She did the same at a red light before crossing over the next intersection at Burleson Road.&nbsp; I also happened to notice her drinking the beverage while
 the bus was actually in motion while northbound on Springdale Road after crossing over East Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and I noticed again that--while the bus in fact was in motion--she again drank from the beverage while northbound on Cameron Road
 while approaching East 52nd Street.<br>
<br>
It may be that Capital Metro is OK with all of this but I will tell you that from the viewpoint of a passenger, these &quot;optics&quot; are not good.&nbsp; If this conduct is NOT in compliance with Capital Metro policy, then please consider this as my formal complaint against
 this driver and a review of the video from the bus would be encouraged.<br>
<br>
Just when I thought that things could not go down-hill any further, Capital Metro proved me wrong.<br>
<br>
A bit later that same day, I boarded a NORTHBOUND Route 383 bus (Vehicle number 2565 and, according to the overhead display, Operator ID 305830) which departed the North Lamar Transit Center at 5:30 pm.<br>
When the bus arrived on northbound Burnet Road, just south of Longhorn Boulevard at approximately 5:40 pm (at the bus stop labeled &quot;Rutland&quot;<br>
station), the driver suddenly parked and then exited from the bus.<br>
She struck up a conversation with a man who was standing near the bus stop and then got on her cell phone to make a call.&nbsp; At first, this angered me.&nbsp; However, she later told those of us onboard that this was the location at which there was to be a switch of
 drivers as she, herself, would be re-assigned to a different route at that point.<br>
<br>
We sat there on vehicle 2565 and waited and waited and waited.&nbsp; She then told us that we would have to resume our travel on the next-scheduled Route 383 bus.&nbsp; At 6:09 pm--having waited for a half hour--the next-scheduled Route 383 bus (vehicle 2512) did arrive
 and all of us exited vehicle 2565 in order to board vehicle 2512.&nbsp; This was a significant delay for me in getting to my destination and it does not reflect well upon Capital Metro to have this level of disorder in its administrative functions.<br>
<br>
The average Austinite has a choice in the matter because--unlike me--the average Austinite has access to a vehicle.&nbsp; Pandemic--or no pandemic--these examples from yesterday show why the average Austinite will not bother to use public transportation (and relieve
 traffic congestion on Austin's notoriously-busy roadways) as there are so many examples of difficulty and poor-quality service in what should be the simple task of getting people from Point A to Point B in timely fashion.<br>
<br>
A reply would be much-appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
GREGORY WATSON<br>
