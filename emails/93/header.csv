I have, or had should I say, a ticket that expires later in the month. 31-Day Ticket was purchased January 25.However, this morning trying to use the pass once clicked on, screen would go black. Now a few minutes later that app says that I have no passes available.
I've had to buy another day pass with cash for this inconvenience. When can it be solved? I'm still owed atleast a week and a half on the pass I purchased, plus the day pass that I had again.
There was someone else on the #20 bus who was having the same
issue.ThanksEdgardo Pinamark245pineapple@gmail.comApp Name: Capital MetroApp Version : 4.31.2 1057OS Version : 10
