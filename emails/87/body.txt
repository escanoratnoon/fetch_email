Hi there,
Earlier today the app would not open  an active ticket of mine meant to
remain active until the 14th, and now I find it is deleted.  Even after
closing and redownloading the metro app,  it does not allow me to refresh
or rebuy a new ticket. I've downloaded money twice.

I need this app to work by 7am tomorrow morning so that I may go to work in
the freezing temperatures. Please let me know as soon as possible how this
can be fixed.
