So I did. 3 times. Then I decided to wait. Tried riding the bus and my active monthly pass was erased. Tried purchasing a daily pass and italso said transaction wascancelled to try again. Ended up buying a daily pass cash to ride bus. I looked on my bank account and all the passes were charged. But when I log in to the Cap Metro App it shows no available passes. How can I resolve this issue??And May I please get a refund for my money?? Thank you!
