Thank you. Will my money be reimbursed for all the bus passes I was charged and have not used or activated?

Ms. Garcia,



The issue should be resolved. Please check to see if you can see and access your passes.



Thank you,

Sondra Williams

I tried to purchase a new monthly pass and it said my transaction was cancelled to try again. So I did. 3 times. Then I decided to wait. Tried riding the bus and my active monthly pass was erased. Tried purchasing a daily pass and it also said transaction was cancelled to try again. Ended up buying a daily pass cash to ride bus. I looked on my bank account and all the passes were charged. But when I log in to the Cap Metro App it shows no available passes. How can I resolve this issue?? And May I please get a refund for my money?? Thank you! [Image]
