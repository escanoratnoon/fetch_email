Hi,

I've been having issues accessing my 31-day pass, on my phone, since
yesterday. The pass is in my app under "available", but when I click on it
my screen goes black and the app crashes.
And on a semi-related note, I've also tried buying two of the $2.50 day
passes through the app via Google Pay, but got two "order failed" messages.
However, my card was still charged it seems, so I may need a refund on
those.

Thanks for any help!
