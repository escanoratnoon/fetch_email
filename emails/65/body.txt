I have been offered a job at IRS on south IH35. They offered me the second
shift. I use the city bus for all my transportation.  I do not drive. I can
get to work fine but I  don't get off till 1230. The last bus leaves at
1145 headed back north where I  live.

Please answer soon as possible as I must accept or reject job.
