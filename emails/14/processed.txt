John,
 so the customer did activate all the passes on the same day, not sure why, but they were not locked because they were being used.
 Let the customer know as a onetime courtesy we will credit back two of the passes that were activated.

Good afternoon,
It looks like this customer
keketapri@gmail.com
 activated three day passes on the 7th, and they ended up locked.
It looks like the customer would like a credit for the locked passes.
Are we able to offer any assistance for this customer?
Thank you,
John Torres
