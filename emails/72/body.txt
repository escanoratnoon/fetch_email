Good afternoon, my husband and I are grateful that you do pick up in our
neighborhood.

I am reaching out to see if I can follow up with someone about increasing
the pick up area. I ask this because of days like this when it is extremely
cold.

We are requesting that he be picked up at 706 Sly Pass, Austin, TX 78748

The driver's actual pass near our house. If they turned on Archdale and
turned right on Sly Pass they would be facing in the correct direction to
leave the neighborhood.

We understand the distance barrier. Is there anyway to update that so that
drivers can pick him up from home please?

Thank you in advance for your help in this matter. We appreciate any help
you can provide.

Sincerely grateful,
 Dawn Trenholm Colvin
