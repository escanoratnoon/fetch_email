Would appreciate any assistance you can provide on my situation....
 

 
 I was in an automobile accident between 5am-5:30am. The incident involved a hit and run. There was a bus right behind me. Just wondering if any drivers documented, or made a call, and if there is footage available.

 
 Traveling East on HWY 71, near Bergstrom International Airport. Between Presidential Blvd and 973.Thank you for your time.
