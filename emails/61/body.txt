    Good morning. Would appreciate any assistance you can provide on my
situation....

    I was in an automobile accident between 5am-5:30am. The incident
involved a hit and run. There was a bus right behind me. Just wondering if
any drivers documented, or made a call, and if there is footage available.

    Traveling East on HWY 71, near Bergstrom International Airport. Between
Presidential Blvd and 973.

Thank you for your time.
