Hard to take you guys serious without action. What's even more frustrating as I read this email. Boom!!!! Here it is the same exact situation. So here it is having to complain again. I'm sure I'm not the only one This point. I work in a call center, I know customer service. So you can continue to use your kind word and empathetic statements. It's clear our concerns are falling on deaf ears. I just hate that I have to take this bus, and use your services because it's not worth Jack.
