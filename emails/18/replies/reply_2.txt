I just want to say that the 392/243 is the worst bus route.
How you have two different busses in one route? When they aren't consistent. I'm tired of complaining about it. I more tired of having to wait 2 hrs to get home work when I live less than 10 minutes away. It's like you guys don't care about the ones who aren't fortunate enough to have a car.  I just don't see how the 243 will go west bound then get to tech ridge and go back east instead of continuing west like it's supposed to. Then when the 243 is pulling up the 392 is leaving. It's MAJOR inconvenience. I've complained over the phone so many times and yet nothing has been adjusted. After talk to others I know I'm not the only one to complain. The level of inconsideration is down right disrespectful and disgusting.
