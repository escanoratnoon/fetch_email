Subject: Physical Day Pass Purchase
Hello,
I work for a non profit and we are trying to purchase day bus passes for the women in job training. We would like to have physical
passes so that we can distribute them to the women when they are needed. Could you please let me know how
I can go about making this purchase.
Thank you for your time!
Kind Regards,
