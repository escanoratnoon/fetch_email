I believe that now that folks are indoors 24/7 in shelters and the Palmer Center, the rest of details such as food is going to be attended to and resolved.
Even as we BEAUTIFULLY came together to raise our voices of support for what is needed, folks in city hall were working hard in very complex and complicated ways, successfully.
They deserve a
 little rest.
My opinion, for those willing and able to CAREFULLY drive in this freeze, bring blankets, hat, glove---better yet ask for what they see is needed.
In deep gratitude
Irit
