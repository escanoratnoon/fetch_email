Subject: Re: Cold Weather Shelters Activated
Michelle Myles,
What about the rest of the week? You do not want to wait until the roads are impassable to make sure there is plenty of food available.
I think there was an attempt
for warm foods to be delivered. Are your meals available warm or cold foods?
Does the shelter have a kitchen for food preparations?
Respectfully,
