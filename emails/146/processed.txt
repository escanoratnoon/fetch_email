If the person in the electric wheelchair is stranded outside and/or is at risk First responders should be called.Electric Wheelchairs are typically used for those that can not use a manual wheelchair. Electric wheelchairs have a manual release lever so that someone can push them in an emergency. Cold weather is bad for any batteries.As I predicted, in a previous email, Cap Metro will deny transportation to destinations and cold weather shelters (CWS) due to the weather.

In this case the paratransit service denied service
based on weather and (a disability if the regular buses are still running). The paratransit system must still run as long as the main bus route runs to give people with disabilities equal access to CWS that can not use the regular buses. The main bus routes will also shut down due to weather.Additionally, They should extend their 1/4 mile limits from the nearest bus routes or bus stops to ensure people with a disability can get access to transportation,
especially in a disaster
area or state of emergency. They need to be door to door service.The Governor
has declared a state of emergency due to the weather and the pandemic.Due to travel barriers, People need to be able to remotely register for CWS from any location and get a hotel in their immediate area for the duration of the CW declarations, preferably
a hotel that has food service and willing to service
meals and that is accessible without having to travel outside the building as it may become impassable.Question, do first responders have spiked tires for icy
conditions or at least tire chains?Respectfully,John WoodleyAdvocates for Disability AccessOn Sun, Feb 14, 2021 at 12:48 PM Valerie Leal Valerie@trinitycenteraustin.org wrote:

I have a disabled homeless friend I was trying
to get into a hotel for tonight. Her wheelchair batteries
stopped working because
of the cold and Cap Metro cancelled the ride she had scheduled due to
bad weather conditions. What are your thoughts?

Good evening all,
Registration at the Central Library for
Cold Weather Shelters
is getting underway. People can use
Cap Metro services to ride, and no one will be denied transportation to their
destination due to lack of fare for the duration of the cold weather event. Once at the Central Library free transportation will be provided to an overnight shelter.
Kindly,
-Lara

I believe that now that folks are indoors 24/7 in shelters and the Palmer Center, the rest of details such as food is going to be attended to and resolved.
Even as we BEAUTIFULLY came together to raise our voices of support for what is needed, folks in city hall were working hard in very complex and complicated ways, successfully.
They deserve a
 little rest.
My opinion, for those willing and able to CAREFULLY drive in this freeze, bring blankets, hat, glove---better yet ask for what they see is needed.
In deep gratitude

Michelle Myles,
What about the rest of the week? You do not want to wait until the roads are impassable to make sure there is plenty of food available.
I think there was an attempt
for warm foods to be delivered. Are your meals available warm or cold foods?
Does the shelter have a kitchen for food preparations?
Respectfully,
John Woodley

I just went to Palmer to drop off hot casseroles and they did not take them as they are not set up to receive hot food.
The volunteer I spoke with was very nice but he said they were set up to take in people who lost power but the only people who were there so far were homeless.
They do have snacks set out but no meals.
*In case any other organization was planning on bringing food. Seems like it may need to be approved as they didnât have a plan for meals
