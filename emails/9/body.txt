Yes it was the 7-Dual/Dove springs NB, and it was the  2501 Parker/Braxton stop that it happened. A little bit before I message you yesterday. I was on my way to bustop, but not there yet. I waved the bus down. The bus driver saw and  pulled over. As I was getting closer to the bus, the bus pulled away and drove off before I could get in.

I just try to get on the 7 bus route from Parker. I waved down the bus who started to slow down and pull over, then he drove off without picking me up. I'm tired of these bus drivers doing this. I've had a time before were another bus driver was just gonna drive on pass if I didn't wave him down.
