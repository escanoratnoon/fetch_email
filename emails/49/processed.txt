I recently tried to reinstall the capmetro app to my galaxy phone and was not able to. I chatted with
 Google support
 and ran through all trouble shooting with no new results.
I was directed to contact you for a resolution to my predicament. As I am reliant on the bus services to receive my medication from the pharmacy I hope to have this resolved asap. Thank you.
