<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">Good morning,<div dir="auto">On Tuesday, February 9, 2021 I was rushing to buy my bus ticket and failed to realize I accidentally purchased a week pass instead of a day pass. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to use it because I haven’t needed it so I was hoping I would be able to receive a refund for that accidental purchase so I’m not wasting money!! Please let me know.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">Thank you so much.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">Sincerely,</div><div dir="auto">Najja Lewis&nbsp;</div>
