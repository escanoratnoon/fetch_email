Good morning,On Tuesday, February 9, 2021 I was rushing to buy my bus ticket and failed to realize I accidentally purchased a week pass instead of a day pass. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to use it because I haven’t needed it so I was hoping I would be able to receive a refund for that accidental purchase so I’m not wasting money!! Please let me know.
Thank you so much.
Sincerely,Najja Lewis
