Thank you for taking the time to contact Capital Metro with your question.

 
What type of cell phone do you have?

What is the version on the cell?

I recently tried to reinstall the capmetro app to my galaxy phone and was not able to. I chatted with  Google support  and ran through all trouble shooting with no new results.
 I was directed to contact you for a resolution to my predicament. As I am reliant on the bus services to receive my medication from the pharmacy I hope to have this resolved asap. Thank you.
