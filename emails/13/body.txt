John,  so the customer did activate all the passes on the same day, not sure why, but they were not locked because they were being used.  Let the customer know as a onetime courtesy we will credit back two of the passes that were activated.

Good afternoon,

It looks like this customer keketapri@gmail.com <mailto:keketapri@gmail.com>  activated three day passes on the 7th, and they ended up locked.

It looks like the customer would like a credit for the locked passes.

Are we able to offer any assistance for this customer?

Thank you,
John Torres
