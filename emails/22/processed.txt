Mr. Torres,
Thank you for your quick response. However, that's not what I asked. I asked for an track diagram. Perhaps forwarding this email to someone with an engineering or track operations?
Thanks,
Michael Calcagno

Mr. Calcagno,
Thank you for contacting Capital Metro regarding our Metro Rail.
The map is basically the same, the station was only moved a block from the original station.
Thank you,
John Torres

Subject: Downtown station map request
Hi,
Since CapMetro extended and moved the Downtown station of the Red line. Do you have a track diagram of this section (or the whole way)?
This track diagram is an example of what I'm looking for, this is the old Downtown station.
Thank you,
Michael Calcagno
