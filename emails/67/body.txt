Hi, I'm trying to access my available month pass and it just pops up with a
black screen. When I go to ticket storage (I switch the tickets to store on
my device because the cloud is extremely buggy with the app), it pops up
with "an error has occurred". Please help, I have to get to work by riding
the bus.
