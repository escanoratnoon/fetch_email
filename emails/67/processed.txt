Hi, I'm trying to access my available month pass and it just pops up with a black screen. When I go to ticket storage (I switch the tickets to store on my device because the cloud is extremely buggy with the app), it pops up with "an error has occurred". Please help, I have to get to work by riding the bus.Luke Morrislokithemaker@gmail.comApp Name: Capital MetroApp Version : 4.31.2 1057OS Version : 10
